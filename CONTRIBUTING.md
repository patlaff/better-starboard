# Contributing to better-starboard

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This is a fairly small project, but I'd still love to collaborate with anyone who views this bot as useful for their discord servers/communities.

I've attached a really light code of conduct, primarily just to tick the box on github, but the sentiment is a powerful one: [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Submitting Bugs

Please use the bug report issue template with the [BUG] prefix when submitting bugs. I will prioritize reviewing/remediating bugs over feature requests and welcome pull requests linked to any reported bugs.

## Submitting Feature Requests

Please use the the feature request issue template with the [REQUEST] prefix when submitting feature requests. I will rank feature additions based on the volume of conversation around each feature request. If this project grows, I will find a more streamlined voting system to prioritize backlog.
