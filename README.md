# better-starboard

If you're anything like me and my friends, you use reactions extremely unpredictably in your Discord server.  The problem with most (if not, all) starboards available is that they require the user to specify a particular (or in some cases, a small array) of emojis to use for pinning popular messages to the starboard.  

Better-Starboard takes the opposite approach. This bot will pin any message that gets *any* reaction over a set threshold to the starboard, and allows users to except certain emojis.

This results in, what we believe, is a much more versatile method of archiving popular messages on your server.
